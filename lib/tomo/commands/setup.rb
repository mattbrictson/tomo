          Usage: #{green('tomo setup')} #{yellow('[--dry-run] [options]')}

          Prepare the remote host for its first deploy by sequentially running the
          "setup" list of tasks specified in #{DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH}. These tasks typically
          create directories, initialize data stores, install prerequisite tools,
          and perform other one-time actions that are necessary before a deploy can
          take place.

          Use the #{blue('--dry-run')} option to quickly simulate the setup without actually
          connecting to the host.
