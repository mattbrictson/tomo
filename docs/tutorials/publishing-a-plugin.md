# Publishing a Plugin

In this tutorial we will create tomo plugin that can be shared with the community as a Ruby gem. Here is an overview of the steps involved:

- Start with a [project-based plugin](writing-custom-tasks.md) to prove real-world usage
- Use the [tomo-plugin GitHub template](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo-plugin) to package your plugin as a Ruby gem
- Write unit tests for your tasks using [MockPluginTester](../api/testing/MockPluginTester.md)
- Add docs and continuous integration (CI) to help your users and contributors
- Publish to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org)
