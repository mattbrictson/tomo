## Quick start

Tomo is distributed as a ruby gem. To install:

```
$ gem install tomo
```

For instructions on setting up bash completions, run:

```
$ tomo completion-script
```

#### Configuring a project

Tomo is configured via a `.tomo/config.rb` file in your project. To get started, you can use `tomo init` to generate a configuration that works for a basic Rails app.

![$ tomo init](./readme_images/tomo-init.png)

An abbreviated version looks like this:

```ruby
# .tomo/config.rb

plugin "git"
plugin "bundler"
plugin "rails"
# ...

host "user@hostname.or.ip.address"

set application: "my-rails-app"
set deploy_to: "/var/www/%{application}"
set git_url: "git@github.com:my-username/my-rails-app.git"
set git_branch: "master"
# ...

setup do
  run "git:clone"
  run "git:create_release"
  run "bundler:install"
  run "rails:db_schema_load"
  # ...
end

deploy do
  run "git:create_release"
  run "core:symlink_shared"
  run "core:write_release_json"
  run "bundler:install"
  run "rails:assets_precompile"
  run "rails:db_migrate"
  run "core:symlink_current"
  # ...
end
```

Check out the [configuration docs](https://tomo-deploy.com/configuration/) for a complete reference.

## Usage

Tomo gives you easy-to-use commands for three common use cases:

1. `tomo setup` prepares a remote host for its first deploy
2. `tomo deploy` performs a deployment
3. `tomo run` lets you invoke one-off tasks

### Setup

`tomo setup` prepares the remote host for its first deploy by sequentially running the
[setup](https://tomo-deploy.com/configuration#setupblock) list of tasks specified in `.tomo/config.rb`. These tasks typically create directories, initialize data stores, install prerequisite tools, and perform other one-time actions that are necessary before a deploy can take place.

Out of the box, tomo will:

- Configure necessary environment variables, like `RAILS_ENV` and `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
- Install Ruby, Bundler, Node, Yarn, and dependencies
- Create all necessary deployment directories
- Create the Rails database, load the schema, and insert seed data

### Deploy

Whereas `tomo setup` is typically run once, you can use `tomo deploy` every time you want to deploy a new version of your app. The deploy command will sequentially run the [deploy](https://tomo-deploy.com/configuration#deployblock) list of tasks specified in `.tomo/config.rb`. You can customize this list to meet the needs of your app. By default, tomo runs these tasks:

1. Create a release (using the [git:create_release](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/git#gitcreate_release) task)
2. Build the project (e.g. [bundler:install](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/bundler#bundlerinstall), [rails:assets_precompile](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/rails#railsassets_precompile))
3. Migrate data to the meet the requirements of the new release (e.g. [rails:db_migrate](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/rails#railsdb_migrate))
4. Make the new release the "current" one ([core:symlink_current](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/core#coresymlink_current))
5. Restart the app to use the new current release (e.g. [puma:restart](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/puma#pumarestart))
6. Perform any cleanup (e.g. [bundler:clean](https://tomo-deploy.com/plugins/bundler#bundlerclean))

### Run

Tomo can also `run` individual remote tasks on demand. You can use the `tasks` command to see the list of tasks tomo knows about.

![$ tomo tasks](./readme_images/tomo-tasks.png)

One of the built-in Rails tasks is `rails:console`, which brings up a fully-interactive Rails console over SSH.

![$ tomo run rails:console](./readme_images/tomo-run-rails-console.png)

### Extending tomo

Tomo has many plugins built-in, but you can easily add your own to extend tomo with custom tasks. By convention, custom plugins are stored in `.tomo/plugins/`. These plugins can define tasks as plain ruby methods. For example:

```ruby
# .tomo/plugins/my-plugin.rb

def hello
  remote.run "echo", "hello", settings[:application]
end
```

Use `remote.run` to execute shell scripts on the remote host, similar to how you would use Ruby's `system`. Project settings are accessible via `settings`, which is a plain Ruby hash.

Load your plugin in `config.rb` like this:

```ruby
# .tomo/config.rb

plugin "./plugins/my-plugin.rb"
```

And run it!

![$ tomo run my-plugin:hello](./readme_images/tomo-run-hello.png)

## FAQ

#### What does the `unsupported option "accept-new"` error mean?

By default, tomo uses the ["accept-new"](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.6) value for the StrictHostKeyChecking option, which is supported by OpenSSH 7.6 and newer. If you are using an older version, this will cause an error. As a workaround, you can override tomo's default behavior like this:

```ruby
# Replace "accept-new" with something compatible with older versions of SSH
set ssh_strict_host_key_checking: true # or false
```
